<h3>How to play:</h3>
<ol>
   <li> Click the START button	to	begin, the game	status indicator light below the START	
    button	switches from RED to GREEN and game begins after 3 seconds.	
   </li>
   <li> Simon will give the first signal	by randomly	flashing a coloured button.	Repeat the signal by clicking the	
    same colour	buGon.	</li>
    <li> Simon will duplicate the	first signal and add one. Repeat these	 two	 signals	by	clicking	 the	 same	
    colour	buttons, in	order. </li>	
    <li>Simon will duplicate	these first	two	signals	and	add	one.</li>
    <li> Continue	playing	as long	as you	can	repeat each	sequence of	signals	correctly. After the 5th, 9th	
    and	13th signals in	a sequence,	Simon automatically	speeds up the interval between signals.	</li>
    <li> If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or	if you take	more than 5 seconds to repeat a	signal,	
    Simon responds by flashing all four buttons	simultaneously five	times. This	means you have lost,	
    and	the	sequence of	signals	ends. The game status indicator	switches from GREEN	to RED and you	
    will have to click START button	to begin a new game.</li>		
    <li> Your	level is shown in the display to the right of the START	button.	The	all-time highest score is shown	in the	
    display	to	the	left of	the	START button.</li>	
</ol>
